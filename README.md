## Introduction

In this project, we leverage AWS IoT services to create a digital twin for an Iot Smart Gardening System. A digital twin is a virtual representation of a physical device or system that allows monitoring, control, and analysis of the device's data in real-time.

## Features


- **AWS IoT Core**: Connect the physical device to AWS IoT Core for secure communication and device management.

- **AWS Lambda**: Use AWS Lambda functions to perform custom actions based on the data received from the digital twin.

## Prerequisites

- AWS account
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- Python 3.x
-  library
